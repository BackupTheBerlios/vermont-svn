%Network monitoring tools have a long history in the communications domain. 
%Usually, such approaches were integrated into special-purpose applications for accounting or traffic engineering environments. 
%With the development of the Netflow protocol by Cisco, a standardized method emerged that allows a strict separation of monitoring and analysis. The IETF recognized the need for an Internet-wide standard for collecting and transporting monitoring data. Therefore, NetFlow.v9, IPFIX and PSAMP are being standardized as RFCs.

In this section, we provide a brief overview to open-source implementations of monitoring probes.
There are several implementations supporting the NetFlow.v9 format, e.g. nprobe~\cite{deri2003nprobe} and NetMate~\cite{schmoll2004netmate}. Currently, the authors of these tools are working on IPFIX compliant versions.
Table~\ref{tab:features} compares the supported features of these implementations and Vermont.
%Futher, there exist implementations at Cisco Systems and IBM~\cite{ibm-ipfix} which are not available under an open-source compatible license and as such not listed here.

Vermont, being a reference implementation for both the IPFIX and the PSAMP standard, already supports IPFIX, PSAMP, and IPFIX aggregation schemes.
