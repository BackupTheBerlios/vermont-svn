\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present Vermont, a flexible network monitoring toolkit for packet filtering and packet sampling, flow accounting, and flow aggregation. This toolkit supports the export and collection of IPFIX/PSAMP compliant monitoring data.
Packet capturing is based on the well-known pcap library, which enables deployment on various hardware platforms and operating systems. 
Apart from an overview to Vermont's architecture, we present evaluation results with regard to performance, interoperability, and robustness.
Furthermore, we compare Vermont to other open-source implementations of monitoring probes with respect to supported features and functionality.
