\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented Vermont, a monitoring probe for IPFIX/PSAMP compliant flow monitoring and packet sampling. Vermont has fulfilled its design goal of providing a versatile high-speed monitoring toolkit consisting of a modular, reusable, and freely configurable architecture.The performance on state-of-the-art PC systems is satisfactory. Nevertheless, optimizations are possible if used for standard flow accounting not requiring the flexible, rule-based aggregation scheme. Excellent compatibility and high robustness have been proven in interoperability tests. Vermont is available as an open-source package~\cite{vermont-site}.
