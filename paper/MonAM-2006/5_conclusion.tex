\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented Vermont, a monitoring toolkit for IPFIX/PSAMP compliant flow monitoring and packet sampling. Vermont has fulfilled its design goal of providing a versatile high-speed monitoring toolkit consisting of a modular, reusable, and freely configurable architecture.The performance on state-of-the-art PC systems is satisfactory. Nevertheless, improvements are still needed if Vermont if used as a pure flow monitor. On the other hand, excellent compatibility and high robustness have been proven in interoperability tests. Vermont is available as an open-source package~\cite{vermont-site}.
