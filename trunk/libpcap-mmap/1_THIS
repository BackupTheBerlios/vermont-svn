This is a patched version of libpcap with mmap() support.
It is based upon http://public.lanl.gov/cpw/libpcap-1.0.20050129.tar.gz

The pcap_stats() was corrected to return (like the old pcap) counts since
the last call, not accumulated.

The patch consists of


-                handle->md.stat.ps_recv = handle->md.kstats_total.tp_packets;
-                handle->md.stat.ps_drop = handle->md.kstats_total.tp_drops;
+                handle->md.stat.ps_recv = kstats.tp_packets;
+                handle->md.stat.ps_drop = kstats.tp_drops;
