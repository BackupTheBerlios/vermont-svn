Bootstrap complete.  It's time to run configure.  If you are just messing
around then:

  ./configure
  make clean
  make

is sufficient.  A static library will be found in file "libpcap.a".

If you want to build libpcap as a shared library, then:

  ./configure --enable-shared
  make clean
  make

You will find the shared library in the .libs directory.

Finally, if you want to install the library in /usr/lib, then:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-shared
  make clean
  make install
  ldconfig

Good luck.  And remember, there is no warrantee.  You are basically on 
your own.  If you already have a libpcap from your favorite "vendor", these
last steps may not provide you with what you want since "root" is required
and various libpcap based applications on your system are expecting some
specific pcap version.  I found that judicious symlink's in /usr/lib

  such as:

    ln -s libpcap-0.8.2.so libpcap-0.7.2.so

  and a ldconfig seems to help.
